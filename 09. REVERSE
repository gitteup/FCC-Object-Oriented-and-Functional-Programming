//NOTES:

//You can use the reverse method to reverse the elements of an array.

//reverse is another array method that alters the array in place, but it also returns the reversed array.

//#1 

var myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.reverse();

//#2

var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
var newArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

newArray = array.reverse();
