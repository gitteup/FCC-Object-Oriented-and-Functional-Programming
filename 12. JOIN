//NOTES:

//We can use the join method to join each element of an array into a 
//string separated by whatever delimiter you provide as an argument.

//#1 (join and)

var veggies = ["Celery", "Radish", "Carrot", "Potato"];
var salad = veggies.join(" and ");
console.log(salad); // "Celery and Radish and Carrot

//#2 (join spaces)

var joinMe = ["Split","me","into","an","array"];
var joinedString = '';

// Only change code below this line.

joinedString = joinMe.join(" ");
