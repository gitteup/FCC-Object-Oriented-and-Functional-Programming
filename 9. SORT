//NOTES: 

//You can use the method sort to easily sort the values in an array alphabetically or numerically.

//Unlike the previous array methods we have been looking at, sort actually alters the array in place.
//However,it also returns this sorted array.

var array = [1, 12, 21, 2];
array.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
